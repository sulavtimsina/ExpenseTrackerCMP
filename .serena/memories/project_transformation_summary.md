# Expense Tracker Project Summary

## 🎉 Project Transformation Complete!

We have successfully transformed the CMP-Bookpedia project into a fully functional **Expense Tracker** application using Compose Multiplatform.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Complete Architecture Transformation**
- **Database**: Migrated from Room to SQLDelight for true multiplatform support
- **Domain**: Created comprehensive expense management domain with categories, validation, and error handling
- **Presentation**: Built complete MVVM architecture with ViewModels for all screens
- **Navigation**: Implemented proper navigation flow between screens

### 2. **Core Features Implemented**
- ✅ **Add Expense**: Complete form with amount, category, note, date, and optional receipt image
- ✅ **Expense List**: Scrollable list with search, category filtering, and delete functionality
- ✅ **Expense Detail**: Full expense details with edit and delete options
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: SQLDelight database with proper schema and migrations
- ✅ **Responsive UI**: Adaptive layouts for mobile and desktop interfaces

### 3. **Platform Support Verified**
- ✅ **Android**: APK builds successfully (API 24+ targeting API 35)
- ✅ **Desktop**: Application runs successfully on macOS
- ✅ **iOS**: Code compiles (frameworks build successfully)
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Shared business logic across all platforms

### 4. **Architecture & Quality**
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Domain, data, and presentation layers properly separated
- ✅ **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModels handle business logic, screens handle UI
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Koin modules for proper dependency management
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Functional Result types for robust error management
- ✅ **State Management**: Reactive UI with StateFlow and Compose

### 5. **Test Coverage Created**
- ✅ **Domain Tests**: ExpenseCategory, Expense model, Result type functionality
- ✅ **Data Layer Tests**: Mappers between domain and database models
- ✅ **Presentation Tests**: ViewModel behavior and state management
- ✅ **Repository Tests**: Database operations and error scenarios
